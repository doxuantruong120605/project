//             officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe Olympiade) 
//             and commonly known as Paris 2024, is an upcoming international multi-sport event 
//             scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with Paris as

//             plus one subsite in Tahiti—an island within the French overseas country and overseas

//             Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. 
//             After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, 
//             the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 
//             2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two cities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, 
//             Paris will become the second city, after London (who were the hosts in 1908 and 1948 and 2012), 
//             to host the Summer Olympics three times. Paris 2024 will mark the centenary of Paris 1924, 
//             and these Olympic Games will be the sixth hosted by France (three in summer and three in winter), 
//             and the first French Olympics since the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Following Paris 2024, 
//             the Summer Games will return to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, as the 2020 Summer 
//             Olympics in Tokyo was delayed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

//             Paris 2024 will feature the debut of breaking (also known as breakdancing) as an Olympic event, 
//             and it will be the final Olympic Games held during the presidency of IOC President 
//             Thomas Bach. The Games will be the first to feature identical number of athletes 
//             between men and women. The question regarding the participation of Russian and 
//             Belarusian athletes has been debated in the lead-up to the event.
