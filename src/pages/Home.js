                Competition in many sports between countries around the world.<br></br>
                The Olympics include the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics held<br></br>
                alternately every 2 years (in even years). This is a sports festival<br></br>
                that is not only a physical competition but also symbolizes the spirit<br></br>
                of solidarity and peace of all humanity.<br></br>

                The Olympics originated from ancient Greek sports competitions from 776 BC<br></br> 
                until Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned them in 394.[4] And the modern Olympics<br></br>
                were first organized by French Baron Pierre Fr√®dy de Coubertin at the end of the<br></br>
                19th century. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) became the governing body<br></br>
                of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter determine its structure and authorities.<br></br>

                The Summer Olympics have been held every four years since 1896, except in years of world wars<br></br> 
                (such as World War II).<br></br>

                The Winter Olympics were established in 1924 for winter sports. Initially it was held in the<br></br>
                same year as the Summer Olympics, but since 1994, the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympics have <br></br>
                taken place alternately every two years.<br></br>
